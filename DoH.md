Configure DoH on your browser

There are several browsers compatible with DNS over HTTPS (DoH). This protocol lets you encrypt your connection to 1.1.1.1 in order to protect your DNS queries from privacy intrusions and tampering.

Some browsers might already have this setting enabled.

    In the General menu, scroll down to access Network Settings.
